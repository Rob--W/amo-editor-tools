My tools to make life more pleasant for AMO reviewers!

## Features

- Add extra column to review queue that shows the size of the files (JS minus
  libraries, and some other categories).

## Usage

This is currently a SDK add-on because WebExtensions cannot run on AMO.
You need an unbranded/non-release Firefox version to load the unsigned xpi.

```
jpm xpi
```

If others find this useful too, I may upload it to AMO.
